# Simulation-and-Analysis-of-V2V-Communications
This is my final thesis at Northwestern University

### Abstract
In this thesis, we mainly focus on the simulation and analysis of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication
based on the DSRC (Dedicated Short Range Communication) system adopting IEEE 802.11 DCF MAC protocol
(CSMA/CA). We obtain results that compare the packet delivery ratio and mean packet delay between heavy and low
vehicle load scenarios under a fully-connected vehicle network case and a hidden terminal participation case. We also
characterize the packet delivery ratio and mean packet delay of safety messages generated with deterministic inter-arrival
time and exponential inter-arrival time, respectively. Our analytical model is shown to provide a good match with
simulation results. We then study on improvement on DSRC performance, proposing an analytical model of Contention
Intensity Control with Rate Control (CICRC). The simulation results we obtained show the packet delivery ratio under
CICRC increases nearly 10% compared with that under CSMA (CW=16) in heavy vehicle load scenarios. Average
successful packet reception time under CICRC is around 20ms lower than CSMA in heavy vehicle loads, which verifies
that CICRC improves on CSMA for the DSRC performance especially in heavy vehicle load scenarios.
